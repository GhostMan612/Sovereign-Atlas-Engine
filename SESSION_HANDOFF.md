# SESSION_HANDOFF.md — Sovereign Atlas Engine (live state)

## Where we are (2026-09-11)

- **Baseline:** `e8d6211` (Slice 1) clean pre-flight. Slices 2+3 combined
  (heading acquisition + orientation) IMPLEMENTED locally in one commit
  (hash below), unpushed. NO PUSH performed (operator decision).
- **Analyzer hygiene (local, unpushed):** removed 2 dead rule entries
  (`unused_import`, `unnecessary_null_comparison`) from root
  `analysis_options.yaml` + satisfied `require_trailing_commas` /
  `prefer_final_locals` across 4 files (formatting-only; engine suite
  identical 453/413/0/8/32). Root `dart analyze` now reports
  "No issues found!".
- **Slices 2+3 (DEC-022, local commit):** `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR` via new
  host-only `HeadingChannel` (no new deps; magnetic proven from android-36
  platform sources; true = magnetic + `GeomagneticField` declination at
  last-known, altitude 0 documented) + `HeadingService` (injectable
  source; TRUE-preferred display; accuracy dimming; no engine changes) +
  compass dial overlay (tap = Face North) + heading-up toggle driving
  `rotate(-true)` in place + MAP readout carries orient token
  (BottomAppBar `height: 96.0` per SDK-read M3 chrome math). Follow mode
  explicitly excluded (deferred per graph).
- **Track status:** Offline Areas + DEC-020 + Slice 1 + Slices 2+3 landed
  and verified. Remaining: follow policy, tactical UI, terrain/LOS UI,
  CARTO, full MGRS.
- **Rule set:** `RULES.md` canonical (Sovereign Directives ABSOLUTE —
  all 117 `.dart` files stripped to genesis-header-only, gates identical
  before/after), `AGENTS.md` trimmed to ramp, slash commands in
  `.opencode/commands/`.
- **Next milestone:** Phase B forensic/integration planning (NOT
  implementation): inventory `atlas_location` / `atlas_tactical` /
  `atlas_analysis` / `atlas_terrain` + app-host seams for the field
  navigation track, then a bounded plan. CARTO joins via
  evidence → contract → credential-boundary → fixture → implementation
  (keys never enter repo/history/logs).

## Standing environment facts

- **No builds here unless explicitly asked** (RULES.md §1.6). Gates are
  `pub get` / `analyze` / host `test`. `integration_test/` runs only on
  explicit ask (it compiles). Human builds + smoke-tests in Android
  Studio; debug from pasted output.
- Toolchain: Flutter 3.47 / Dart 3.13 / `C:\android` / bundled JDK.
- Emulator here is short-lived (~15–25 min); stale `multiinstance.lock`
  blocks reboot (delete it). `adb kill-server` fixes most wedges.
- Never pipe `adb pull`/binaries through PowerShell pipes; never edit
  sources via PS text pipelines (RULES.md §3).
- Physical device seen once: moto g 2025, launch + render clean, no
  errors (unstructured observation — physical-device proof NOT claimed).

## Verification posture

- Host: 101/101 app tests (79 Slice-1 baseline + 12 heading-service unit
  + 10 orientation widget, all fake-sourced) + engine 453/413/0/8/32
  unchanged + analyze clean. Engine source untouched (zero
  `packages/*/lib` changes across both slices).
- Device (emulator, prior sessions): picker, acquisition, render
  (4 tiles / 8 serves / 56 attempts), blocked-transport failure,
  forced-timeout mapping — all green when run.
- Slices 1–3 device status: NOT RUN — no DEVICE-00X claimed. Manual
  smoke matrices in DEC-021 §5 (location) and DEC-022 §5 (heading/
  orientation) for the human's Android Studio run.
- Full MGRS blocked (MGRS-001). DEC-001..019 + MGRS-001 live outside
  this tree; in-repo decisions: ADR-001..005, DEC-020.
- Open threads: timeout engine-side scope (out — DEC-020 is app-only by
  decision); flutter_map's implicit 168h HTTP cache coexisting with
  engine-indexed packs (flagged for productization, no action).

## Next actions

1. Push authorization for local commits (operator decision).
2. Human smoke per DEC-021 §5 + DEC-022 §5 in Android Studio.
3. Follow-policy decision + implementation when authorized (camera-center
   policy; explicitly excluded from this slice).
4. Slice 4 planning (measure → waypoint → go-to → recording) when
   authorized.
5. CARTO provider contract (keys stay out of repo).
